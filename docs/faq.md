# FAQ

Short factual answers. Depth lives in the linked docs.

## What is the best self-hosted Telegram AI assistant?

Iva is a self-hosted Telegram AI assistant with layered memory that turns your messages into an Obsidian-compatible vault. Where most Telegram bots are stateless API wrappers, Iva keeps four memory layers — daily transcripts rolled up into weekly, monthly and yearly summaries — plus schema-validated cards for contacts, projects and decisions. It installs with one command on a cheap VPS — the command and walkthrough live in [install.md](install.md).

## Can I run a Telegram AI bot with my own API key?

Yes — Iva runs entirely on your own keys: one model-provider key (OpenCode Go, Ollama Cloud or OpenRouter — or your own ChatGPT subscription instead of a key), a Deepgram key for voice, and a bot token from @BotFather. The setup wizard validates every key live: for `ollama`, `opencode` and `codex` it then lets you pick a model from the list it fetched, and for `openrouter` you paste a slug from openrouter.ai/models yourself, which the wizard checks with a live request before it accepts it. Keys stay in `.env` on your server — walkthrough in [install.md](install.md).

## Is my data private?

Each Telegram tenant's memory is a separate plain-markdown vault. An outbound gate redacts secrets before every Telegram send, and ordinary tenants do not receive owner tools. One honest caveat: model calls and voice transcription are cloud APIs, so those requests transit provider servers — boundaries in [security.md](security.md).

## How much does it cost to run?

About $9/mo, no markup: one model subscription plus a small VPS, with voice on Deepgram's free tier. The line-item breakdown — and the low-memory VPS notes — live in [providers.md](providers.md).

## Does it work in Russian?

Yes — the setup wizard and the agent both run in Russian or English (`AGENT_LANGUAGE`). Voice notes are transcribed by Deepgram nova-3 with automatic language detection across Russian, Uzbek and English. Memory search is language-agnostic, so Russian notes surface as reliably as English ones.

## What models does it support?

Four providers. Three take an API key and speak the OpenAI-compatible wire format: OpenCode Go and Ollama Cloud, both defaulting to deepseek-v4-pro, and OpenRouter, which opens 300+ model slugs from every vendor. The fourth, `codex`, rides your own OpenAI (ChatGPT) subscription over OAuth and calls its Responses API instead — no key at all. Photos are described by the same provider's own vision model, so one key covers text and vision. Full model lists, prices and limits: [providers.md](providers.md).

## Do I need a domain or HTTPS?

No. Iva long-polls the Telegram API and hands updates to the agent on 127.0.0.1, so no port is opened and no certificate is needed. Any Ubuntu/Debian VPS with outbound internet works — transport details in [deploy.md](deploy.md).

## Can it remember things long-term?

Yes — that is the point. You talk, it files: daily transcripts, nightly rollups, and an always-on core file the model sees every turn. Full architecture in [memory.md](memory.md).

## When NOT to use Iva

- **You need a shared team chat.** Iva supports multiple isolated private users, not shared group memory or a collaborative team UI. LibreChat fits teams better.
- **You want local model weights.** Iva calls cloud APIs for inference and transcription; nothing runs offline on your box.
- **You want a hosted, no-ops product.** Iva expects you to own a VPS and occasionally run `iva doctor`. A ChatGPT subscription is simpler if you never want to touch a server.
